Often Pareto-optimal solutions can be joined by line or surface. Such boundary is called Pareto-optimal front.

real landings are simulated using model predictive control techniques. 
At each time step system receives state feedback on its actual and predicted 
position in space, and then auto-corrects itself (using thrusters and actuated 
fins) if deviation is too high.

many ways that trajectory optimization can go wrong

One particularly tricky type of bug occurs when there is a family of optimal solutions, rather than a single
unique solution. This causes a failure to converge because the optimization is searching for a locally optimal
solution, which it never finds because many solutions are equally good. The fix is to modify the problem
statement so that there is a unique solution. One simple way to do this is to add a small regularization
term to the cost function, such as the integral of control squared along the trajectory. This puts a shallow
bowl in the objective function, forcing a unique solution. Trajectory optimization problems with non-unique
solutions often have singular arcs, which occur when the optimal control is not uniquely defined by the
objective function. 

A trajectory optimization problem with a non-smooth solution (control) might cause the non-linear
program to converge very slowly. This occurs in our final example: finding the minimal work trajectory to
move a block between two points (¬ß8). There three basic ways to deal with a discontinuous solution (control).
The first is to do mesh refinement (¬ß5.2) so that there are many short segments near the discontinuity. The
second is to slightly modify the problem, typically by introducing a smoothing term, such that the solution
is numerically stiff but not discontinuous. This second approach was used in [55]. The third approach is to
solve the problem using a multi-phase method (see ¬ß9.9), such that the control in each phase of the trajectory
is continuous, and discontinuities occur between phases.

Another common cause of poor convergence in the non-linear programming solver occurs when then ob-
jective and constraint functions are not consistent (see ¬ß5.5). There are many sources of inconsistency that
find their way into trajectory optimization problems: discontinuous functions (abs(), min(), max()...),
random number generators, variable step (adaptive) integration, iterative root finding, and table interpo-
lation. All of these will cause significant convergence problems if placed inside of a standard non-linear
programming solver. Section ¬ß5.5 covers some methods for handling inconsistent functions
