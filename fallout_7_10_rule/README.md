Nudat is strongly connected to the Nuclear Data Sheets, i.e. ENSDF(Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File). These are _evaluated_ data, i.e. recommended values. Naturally, not every publicated half life can and will be (immediatly) incoporated into ENSDF.

? The Janis interface ( http://www.oecd-nea.org/janis/ ) from NEA/OECD provides a convenient means of searching nuclear data from several sources, including the JEFF evaluated data.

The ENSDF data is compiled in the Nudat2 database
