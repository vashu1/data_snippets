People sometimes tell that rise of temperature could simply coincide with indastrial age. If we talk about coincidence it would be nice to specify exact number of probability. After all 1/2, 1/10^10 and 1/10↑↑10 are probabilities of very different nature.

Lets run `python3 code.py` and look at result - graph of temperature anomalies vs CO2 emissions.

![](temperature_anomaly_vs_carbon.png)

Dotted lines are the same carbon graph moved forward/backward 10 years. So time coincides onn scale of several years.

Aaaand there some ten comparable warmings over a MILLION years.

Now lets divide 5-10 per 100,000...
